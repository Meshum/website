							What we collect
						</h2>
						<div class="font-body text-foreground leading-relaxed space-y-4">
							<p>
								We collect only what's required to run the service:
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Account information:</strong> Name, email, company name when you sign up.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Content you give us access to:</strong> We index content from the tools you connect (GitHub, Slack, Confluence, etc.) to provide search functionality. We only access what you explicitly authorize.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Usage data:</strong> Search queries and feature usage to provide the service. We don't track you across the web or collect unnecessary analytics.
							</p>

							<p>
								<strong>To provide the service:</strong> We use your connected content to power search and answer questions.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>To improve Meshum:</strong> We analyze usage patterns to make the product better. All analysis is done in aggregate—we're not reading your individual queries.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>To communicate with you:</strong> Product updates, security notices, and responses to your support requests.

							Privacy & security
						</h2>
						<div class="font-body text-foreground leading-relaxed space-y-4">
							<p>
								<strong>Privacy first:</strong> We believe in collecting only what we need and being transparent about how we use it.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Self-hosted deployments:</strong> If you run Meshum on your own infrastructure, we don't store any of your content. It stays entirely on your servers. We only receive basic usage telemetry (if enabled) to help improve the product.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Cloud deployments:</strong> For cloud-hosted instances, your data is stored on secure infrastructure with automatic backups and redundancy.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Encryption:</strong> Your data is encrypted in transit using industry-standard TLS.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Access control:</strong> Access to data is restricted to authorized personnel who need it to provide support or maintain the service.
